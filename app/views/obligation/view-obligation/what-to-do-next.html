        This amount is based on the data you submitted when you reported your packaging data. It has been approved by the scottish regulator.

     <li><h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Buy PRNs or PERNs for your packaging materials

       <p>To meet your recycling obligations, you must purchase PRNs from an accredited reprocessor or exporter. This certifies that the packaging waste has been properly recycled or exported for recycling. </p>

       </h3>
       
          <p>Once you've purchased PRNs or PERNs, ensure they are accepted by your compliance scheme or regulatory authority. This will help you meet your material obligations and avoid any compliance issues. </p>
