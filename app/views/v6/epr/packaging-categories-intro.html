          Introduction to the packaging categories
        </h1>

        <p>As part of the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme, organisations must submit data about activities they have undertaken within each of the packaging categories.</p>

        <p>In the following sections you'll be asked a series of questions about your activities, these will help you to understand how your organisation is obligated, and what data you need to report.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Packaging definitions</h2>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Primary packaging</h3>
        <p>Primary packaging is packaging conceived as a sales unit to the final user or consumer.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Secondary packaging</h3>
        <p>Secondary packaging is packaging conceived to group a certain number of sales units whether sold to the final user or consumer or a means to stock shelves at the point of sale. It can be removed from the product without affecting its characteristics.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Transit packaging</h3>
        <p>Transit packaging is packaging conceived to aid handling and transport of a number of sales units or grouped packs in order to prevent physical handling and transport damage. Transit packaging does not include road, rail, ship and air containers.</p>
