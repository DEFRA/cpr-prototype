        <p>
          Secondary packaging is conceived so as to constitute at the point of purchase a grouping of a certain number of sales units whether the latter is sold as such to the final user or consumer or whether it serves only as a means to replenish the shelves at the point of sale; it can be removed from the product without affecting its characteristics.

          <p><strong>Example A</strong></p>
          <p>An organisation sells individually boxed ink cartridges, grouped in a cardboard tray covered in plastic wrap, to a retail organisation.</p>
          <p>The retail organisation removes the plastic wrap, disposes of it and displays the ink cartridges on shelves in the cardboard trays. It sells the ink cartridges individually.</p>
          <p>The secondary packaging is the cardboard trays and the plastic wrap.</p>
          <p><strong>Example B - not secondary packaging</strong></p>
          <p>An organisation sells individually boxed ink cartridges, grouped in a cardboard tray covered in plastic wrap, to an end consumer.</p>
          <p>In this example, the cardboard tray and plastic wrap are primary packaging, because theyâ€™re sold to the end consumer as part of the sales unit.</p>
