            Connect your business software to this service via API integration
        </h1>

        <p>Application Programming Interface (API) is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.</p>
        
        <p>Connecting via API will allow your packaging data to be automatically imported into this system for reporting purposes.</p>

        <p>You will need someone with software development expertise to implement an API.</p>

        <p>You can access all of the information you need to integrate your enterprise software with the Extended Producer Responsibility service by clicking <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
